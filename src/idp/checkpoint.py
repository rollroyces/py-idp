"""JSONL-based checkpoint store for process_batch().

A simple append-only ledger of which documents have been processed.
The store is intentionally minimal — it does NOT store the full
extraction (that's the caller's job if they want it persisted). It
records:

  - path:    str  (the source document path; primary key)
  - ok:      bool (True if Pipeline.run succeeded)
  - error:   str | None (failure message, if any)
  - result:  dict | None (extraction on success; None on failure)
  - seconds: float
  - ts:      float (epoch seconds when this doc was processed)

Why JSONL?
  - Append-only: one line per doc, atomic single-line write.
  - Human-readable: easy to ``wc -l`` or ``grep`` for debugging.
  - Crash-safe: a crash mid-batch leaves a partial last line; reader
    skips malformed lines (same pattern as JsonFileStorage).

Why not use the ExtractionCache?
  The cache is keyed by request content (sha256 of schema + backend
  + payload). It does NOT track which PATHS have been processed —
  which is what batch resume needs. The two complement each other:

    - ExtractionCache: same input -> no LLM call (deduplication)
    - CheckpointStore: same path -> skip entirely (batch resume)

  Both can coexist. If both are enabled, the cache catches intra-batch
  duplicates and the checkpoint catches inter-batch resume.

    Concurrency:
        Multiple processes writing to the same checkpoint path will
        contend on a flock. The lock is held only during the brief
        append (single line); reads are unlocked and may see partial
        state. That's fine for batch-resume use cases where you're not
        running two concurrent batches against the same checkpoint.

    Crash safety:
        A crash mid-append leaves a partial trailing line. The reader
        skips malformed lines on load (same approach as
        JsonFileStorage).
